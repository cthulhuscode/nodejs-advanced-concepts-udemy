# Automated Headless Browser Testing

### **Headless Browser**

We know that the User Interface or UI of any software is its most integral part. So, when it comes to Headless Browsers it means a browser without a user interface or “head.” So, when the browser is headless, the GUI is hidden. Therefore, when you use a headless browser to access any website, you can’t see anything. However, the program runs in the background.

A headless browser is similar to a normal browser that performs functions such as navigating pages, clicking links, downloading content, and many more. But, with a normal browser, you can check each step and proceed with the help of a GUI presentation. At the same time, you will use Command-line or Console Interface to keep track of changes.

### **Headless testing**

"Headless testing means that an application is tested without seeing its graphical interface. Headless testing can be performed for the case of web applications with browsers that can run without the GUI layer (i.e. talking directly to the browser/render engines), or for the case of mobile applications with emulators that run without the graphical interface.

One of the benefits of headless testing is that it facilitates test automation in cloud mode, and continuous integration engines that run without GUI. On the other hand, it reduces resource consumption by avoiding interaction with middleware to run the system under test (e.g., a browser with GUI). By using browsers and emulators in headless mode, the overhead (in memory and processor) involved in the browser/emulator interface layer is reduced; in the case of headless testing for WEB applications, it avoids invoking the browser's graphic component and talks directly to the browser engines (browser + render engine).

### **Unit testing**

Assert that one piece of your app is working the way you expect.

### **Integration testing**

Make sure that multiple 'units' work together correctly

### Needed packages

**Jest**

Will help us to run tests and make assertions about the way our application is behaving.

**Puppeteer**

Will help us to launch a Chromium instance and interact with it from JS code that we write.
