# Javascript Proxy

The `Proxy` object allows you to create an object that can be used in place of the original object, but which may redefine fundamental `Object` operations like getting, setting, and defining properties. Proxy objects are commonly used to log property accesses, validate, format, or sanitize inputs, and so on.

You create a `Proxy` with two parameters:

- `target`: the original object which you want to proxy
- `handler`: an object that defines which operations will be intercepted and how to redefine intercepted operations.

_See the `./playground/4_testing/proxies.js` example_
