# Data Caching with Redis

Improve the read performance for a web server.

MongoDB use an _index_ for the _id_ property, but other properties don't use an _index_ by default. That means if you make a query where you use a property different to \__id_, the query will be more slow.

One solution might be creating a new index for the property in question, another one would be creating a _Cache Serve_

Everytime we make a query, first the Cache Server will ask if that one has been executed before, if it hasn't then the query will reach the database and the database will send the data back to the server, but the Cache Server will store that data at the same time.

# Redis

In-memory data store, it's like a tiny database that runs in the memory of the machine and allows to read and write data very quickly.
