# Continuous Integration

**What is CI?**  
Process to merge all code changes into a single branch.

**What is CI server?**  
Server that runs automatic checks (tests) on the codebase to ensure the changes haven't broken anything.

**CI Flow**

1. Push code to Github
2. Travis CI automatically detects pushed code
3. Travis clones our project
4. Travis runs tests using a `.travis.yml` file
5. If tests are OK, Travis sends us an email
