# Enhancing Node Performance

### Cluster Mode

It's used to start up multiple copies of Node that are all running your server inside them.
We cannot somehow trick Node to run into running with multiple threads, but by starting up multiple copies we get multiple instances of the Event Loop, so it vaguely works in a similar fashion making Node kind of "multi-threaded".

This is recommended.

### Worker Threads

The worker theads are going to use the _threadpool_ that is set up by _libuv_ whenever we start up our Node application.

Be careful, this is way more experimental.
