# Internals of Node

Two of the most important Node.js dependencies are the **_V8_** and **_libuv_** projects.

- **_V8_**: executes JS outside of the browser.

- **_libuv_**: C++ open-source project that gives Node access to the OSs underlying filesystem. It gives access to networking and also handles some aspects of concurrency.

**Purpose of Node**

Node.js allow us to do stuff using only Javascript, instead of using C++ to do that. It also provides a bunch of useful modules like _http, fs, path, crypto..._ Some of those functionalities are already implemented in _libuv_ but we don't wanna use C++ because we're Javacript devs xD.

How a Node.js program works

Javascript code calls C++ functions to execute the code.

**_V8_** is used to interpret and execute Javascript code, while **_libuv_** is used for accessing the filesystem and some aspects of concurrency.

# Basics of threads

When a program is run a process is started.

A **thread** can be like a to-do list that has some number of instructions to be executed by the processor.

A **thread** are units of instruction waiting to be executed by the CPU.

The thread is given to the CPU and it will attempt to run every instruction on it. One by one.

A single process can have multiple threads inside of it.

**Scheduling**: the capacity of the OS to decide which thread to process at any given instant time. Scheduling refers to the order the threads are executed.

**OS Scheduler** decides which thread should be processed.
It's important to make sure that urgent threads don't wait too long to be executed.

In order to be able to process different threads without blocking the machine, more CPU cores can be added.

![](./images/node_internals/threads%20and%20multicore.PNG)

Technically one core can process multiple threads at a time through multithreading.

Also the scheduler can have the ability to detect big pauses in processing time due to expensive input and output operations. So the thread can be paused and continue with another thread, then go back.

**Input/Output operations (I/O)**: like reading a file, always takes a non-zero amount of time.

# The Node Event Loop

It's used by Node to handle asynchronous code that we write in our apps.

Whenever we start a Node program, Node automatically creates one thread and executes all of our code inside of that one single thread.

Inside that single thread is something called the Event Loop.

We can think of the Event Loop as a control structure that decides what our one thread should be doing at any given point in time.

# Is Node Single Threaded?

Node is single threaded but that's not the full story, the truth is more complicated. Simply declaring that Node is single-threaded that's not absolutely true, the Event Loop uses a single thread, but a lot of the code that we write, doesn't actually execute inside that thread entirely.

![](./images/node_internals/event%20loop%20single%20threaded.PNG)

The Node Event Loop is truly single-threaded, when we start up a Node program, a single instance of the Event Loop is created and placed into one thread.

That's commonly seen as a bad thing, because it means that our program can only run on one single CPU Core. So Node isn't gonna automatically take advantage of those. So our program won't run as fast as it could be, becasuse it's limited to one single thread.

However some of the functions that are included inside of the standard library of Node are not actually single-threaded.
In other words, **some of the functions that are included inside of Node that we run, they run outside of our Event Loop and outside of that single thread**.

# Testing for single threads

Consider the following code:

    /*
      We're using pbkdf2() function just to do
      some expensive work.

      Notice that both functions are executed at the
      almost exact same time. The 2nd one does not wait
      for the 1st one to be finished.
    */

    const start = Date.now();
    crypto.pbkdf2("a", "b", 100000, 512, "sha512", () => {
      console.log("1: ", Date.now() - start + "ms");
    });

    crypto.pbkdf2("a", "b", 100000, 512, "sha512", () => {
      console.log("2: ", Date.now() - start + "ms");
    });

    /*
      Console results:
      2:  841ms
      1:  854ms
    */

If Node were single-threaded the above code would take almost 2 seconds to finish, but it only took almost 1 second.

This is what happened in reality

![](./images/node_internals/testing%20threads%20code%20execution%20diagram.PNG)

This is a diagram of what happens when executing the above code:
![](./images/node_internals/what%20really%20happens%20when%20calling%20pbkdf2%20function.PNG)

Internally Node.js calls the C++ _pbkdf2_ function, and in that function _libuv_ is used, that means that the function is executed using a _thread pool_.

A **thread pool** is group of 4 threads.
The **thread pool** takes care of the **file I/O and DNS lookup**. All the callbacks, however, are executed on the main thread.

The _libuv_ library gives Node better access to the underlying OS. And it has another responsibility, that is relevant for **some** very particular functions in the standard library.

So for **some** standard library function calls, the Node C++ side and _libuv_ decide to do expensive calculations outside of the Event Loop entirely. They make us of something called a _thread pool_, which is a series of four threads that can be used for running computationally intensive tasks such as the _pbkdf2_ function.

**By default libuv creates 4 threads in this thread pool**. That means that apart from the Event Loop single thread, there are another four threads used for expensive calculations. Many functions will automatically make use of this thread pool.

# Threadpools with multithreading

Now let's consider the _1_internals_of_node/2.2_threads.js_ example.

This is the result:

    >
    1:  1008ms
    2:  1032ms
    4:  1052ms
    3:  1053ms
    5:  1741ms

As we can see, the first 4 are executed in almost 1s and the fifth one is executed also in almost 1s but it had to wait for the first four ones to be completed.

![](./images/node_internals/2.2_threads.js%20thread%20execution.PNG)

So the functions were executed like these but at different time. _See the image above_.

Below we can see at more detail what could happen, but my laptop has 4 cores, this is just an example. The important thing is that the fifth function had to wait for one of the 4 threads to be available.

# Changing Threadpool Size

This is done usign the following code:

    process.env.UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE = 2;

    const OS = require('os');
    process.env.UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE = OS.cpus().length;

It's recommended to asign the number of threads according to the number or cpu cores.

## UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE=size

Set the number of threads used in libuv's threadpool to size threads.

Asynchronous system APIs are used by Node.js whenever possible, but where they do not exist, libuv's threadpool is used to create asynchronous node APIs based on synchronous system APIs. **Node.js APIs that use the threadpool are**:

- all **fs** APIs, other than the file watcher APIs and those that are explicitly synchronous
- asynchronous **crypto** APIs such as _crypto.pbkdf2(), crypto.scrypt(), crypto.randomBytes(), crypto.randomFill(), crypto.generateKeyPair()_
- _dns.lookup()_
- all **zlib** APIs, other than those that are explicitly synchronous

Because libuv's threadpool has a fixed size, it means that if for whatever reason any of these APIs takes a long time, other (seemingly unrelated) APIs that run in libuv's threadpool will experience degraded performance. In order to mitigate this issue, one potential solution is to increase the size of libuv's threadpool by setting the 'UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE' environment variable to a value greater than 4 (its current default value).

# Common threadpool questions

### 1. Can we use the threadpool for javascript code or can only Node.js functions use it?

We can write custom JS that uses the thread pool.

### 2. What functions in Node std library use the threadpool?

This was mentioned above.  
All '**fs**' module functions. Some crypto stuff.  
Depends on OS (Windows vs Unix based).

### 3. How does this threapool stuff fit into the Event Loop?

Tasks running in the threadpool are the 'pendingOperations' in our code example at _1_eventLoop.js_

Any pending long running operations. Example: a function call inside the _fs_ module to read some file off the hard drive.

Those kind of tasks could use a threadpool to be executed.

# Explaining OS Operations

Let's consider that we make the same HTTP request several times and check the time that each request takes to be completed.

We could get something like the following:

    >
    433ms
    440ms
    451ms
    458ms
    481ms
    520ms
    567ms

We start to notice that most of the requests take almost the exact same amount of time, unlike the past example when we were using the threadpool in which every 4 calls to the function the time increased by almost 1s.

Since we're making an HTTP request, this type of operation is a OS Operation, that means that the OS is in charge of handling this task instead of _libuv_ using a threadpool to handle it.

![](./images/node_internals/libuv%20use%20of%20OS%20Async%20Helpers.PNG)

_libuv_ also has some functions that make use of code that is built into the underlying OS.
In this case _libuv_ sees that we're attempting to make an HTTP request, neither _libuv_ nor Node has any code to handle all of the super low level operations that are involved with a network request. Instead, _libuv_ deletegates the request making to the underlying OS.
So it's actually our OS that does the real HTTP request.

_libuv_ is used to issue the request and it just waits on the OS to emit a signal that some response has come back to the request. The OS itself decides whether to make a new thread or not, or just generally determine how to handle the entire process.  
Since the OS is making the request, there is not blocking of our Node code or Event Loop, the http request is being executed outside of the Event Loop.

# OS/Async common questions

### 1. What functions in Node Std Lib use the OS's async features?

Almost everything around networking for all OS's. Some other stuff is OS specific.

### 2. How does this OS async stuff fit into the Event Loop?

Tasks using the underlying OS are reflected in our pendingOSTasks array at exercise _1_eventLoop.js_.
